# sum-of-even-fibonacci-numbers

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

```
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
```

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the EVEN-valued numbers.

Hint: create a method:

```
def even_fibonacci_sum(limit)
  # your code here
end 
```

`even_fibonacci_sum(4000)` should return 3382. So what will `even_fibonacci_sum(4000000)` return?
